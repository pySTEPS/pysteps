pysteps.blending.steps
======================

Implementation of the STEPS stochastic blending method as described in
:cite:`BPS2006`. The method assumes the presence of one NWP model or ensemble
member to be blended with one nowcast. More models, such as in :cite:`SPN2013`
is possible with this code, but we recommend the use of just two models.
