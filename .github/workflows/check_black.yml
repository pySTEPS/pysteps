# This workflow will test the code base using the LATEST version of black

# IMPORTANT: Black is under development. Hence, minor fommatting changes between
# different version are expected.
# If this test fails, install the latest version of black and then run black.
# Preferably, run black only on the files that you have modified.
# This will faciliate the revision of the proposed changes.
