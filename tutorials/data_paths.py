## Example data paths (specify the relevant paths*): 
path_inputs  = "/users/ned/pySTEPS/pysteps-data"   # the root path to the input radar files**
path_outputs = "/users/ned/pySTEPS/out"   # the path where to save outputs (figures, forecasts, etc)
# (*) do not include the backslash / at the end of the path
# (**) this folder should contain two subdirectories (fmi and mch).
# It can be created by unzipping the file archive.zip in the directory /home/username/pySTEPS/data. 
# The file archive.zip is available on https://pysteps.github.io/
