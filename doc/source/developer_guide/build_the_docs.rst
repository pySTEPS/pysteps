Building the docs
=================

The pysteps documentations is build using
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_,
a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation

The documentation is located in the **doc** folder in the pysteps repo.

Automatic build
---------------

The simplest way to build the documentation is using tox and the tox-conda
plugin (conda needed).
To install these packages activate your conda development environment and run::

    conda install -c conda-forge tox tox-conda

Then, to build the documentation, from the repo's root run::

    `tox -e docs`

This will create a conda environment will all the necessary dependencies and the
data needed to create the examples.


Manual build
------------
To build the docs you need to need to satisfy a few more dependencies
related to Sphinx that are specified in the doc/requirements.txt file:

- sphinx
- numpydoc
- sphinxcontrib.bibtex
- sphinx_rtd_theme
- sphinx_gallery

You can install these packages running `pip install -r doc/requirements.txt`.

In addition to this requirements, to build the example gallery in the
documentation the example pysteps-data is needed. To download and install this
data see the installation instructions in the :ref:`example_data` section.

Once these requirements are met, to build the documentation, in the **doc**
folder run::

    make html

This will build the documentation along with the example gallery.

The build documentation (html web page) will be available in
**doc/_build/html/**.
To correctly visualize the documentation, you need to set up and run a local
HTTP server. To do that, in the **doc/_build/html/** directory run::

    python -m http.server

This will set up a local HTTP server on 0.0.0.0 port 8000.
To see the built documentation open the following url in the browser:
http://0.0.0.0:8000/
