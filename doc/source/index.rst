pySTEPS -- The nowcasting initiative
====================================

pySTEPS is a community-driven initiative for developing and maintaining an easy
to use, modular, free and open source Python framework for short-term ensemble
prediction systems.

The focus is on probabilistic nowcasting of radar precipitation fields,
but pySTEPS is designed to allow a wider range of uses.
